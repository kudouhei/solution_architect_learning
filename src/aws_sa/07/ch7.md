# Ensuring Business Continuity

### Disaster Recovery versus High Availability
- **Disaster recovery (DR)** is the process that tackles both the prevention of a disaster and the recovery from a disaster.

- **High availability (HA)** addresses how a workload can keep functioning even though some of its components are impacted by a failure.

How do the two compare with each other? Simply put, HA deals with local failures while DR deals with large-scale failures, so they complete each other.

DR objectives are usually described with two specific KPIs: the `recovery time objective (RTO)` and the `recovery point objective (RPO)`.

The RTO describes the amount of downtime allowed to your workload following a disaster before it is back online. The RPO defines the amount of time between the disaster and the latest data recovery point; in other words, how much data your workload is allowed to lose.

### DR Options on AWS
Your options to deal with a disaster in AWS can be mapped onto four major DR strategies: backup and restore, pilot light, warm standby, and active-active.
- **Backup and Restore**
The idea is to simply take a backup of your workload where it operates in Region A. Then, you somehow transfer that backup at regular intervals to the location where you intend to restore your workload in case of a disaster. 

Provided that backup and restore can satisfy your RTO, the optimal backup frequency is the one that allows you to satisfy your RPO. The RPO will define how much data you are allowed to lose in case of a disaster. 

- **Pilot Light**
The pilot light approach consists of maintaining a copy of your data in a secondary region and your workload infrastructure in a pre-provisioned but switched-off mode.

- **Warm Standby**
The warm standby approach goes a step further compared to the pilot light one. It extends the same concept but also maintains a running copy, although scaled down, of your workload.

- **Active-Active**
The multi-region active-active approach is the ultimate DR approach for the most business-critical workloads, for which none of the previous three approaches could satisfy your RTO and RPO. 

### Detecting a Disaster and Testing DR
The first step, before you can take any countermeasures, is to detect that a disaster is actually taking place.
Consider a situation where you have an RTO of 4 hours with an RPO of 1 hour. This implies that you have up to 4 hours to recover in case of a disaster, but you cannot lose more than an hourâ€™s worth of data. It also means that, whenever a disaster occurs, you must be able to detect the event rapidly enough to notify the stakeholders, escalate if needed, and trigger the DR response within 1 hour (to meet your RPO).

There are a number of things you can do to make sure to detect disasters on time:
- Firstly, AWS offers a general service health dashboard that you can check to get the latest status information about AWS services in near real-time services.
- Secondly, AWS provides the AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD), which lists the service events that affect your workloads.
