You can use jobs to perform tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or any scenario where on-demand processing is required. Container apps and jobs run in the same environment, allowing them to share capabilities such as networking and logging.</p>\n<p>A job's trigger type determines how the job is started. The following trigger types are available:</p>\n<p>Manual: Manual jobs are triggered on demand.</p>\n<p>Schedule: Scheduled jobs are triggered at specific times and can run repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Event: Event-driven jobs are triggered by events such as a message arriving in a queue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/jobs?tabs=azure-cli\">Jobs in Azure Container Apps (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></p>\n",
